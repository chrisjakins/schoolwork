Programming Assignment 01

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:

  * Demonstrate (elementary) understanding of how to write,
    compile, and run a trivial program in three useful languages,
    C#, Java, and Python.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background:

  * Just three "Hello, world!" programs to ensure that you have a
    working environment for the languages C#, Java, and Python 3.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks:

  1. Download HMWK_01_dalioba.zip from Canvas.

  2. Unzip the file somewhere convenient.

  3. Change 'dalioba' in the name of the directory to your NetID.
     (Your NetID is three letters followed by four or five digits.
      The directory name will now be something like
      'hmwk_01_abc1234', where 'abc1234' is YOUR NetID.)

  4. Look in that directory.

  5. Change the header lines in the files hmwk_01.cs / .java / .py.

      -- Line 1:  Family name first, then a comma, then
                  personal name.

      -- Line 2:  Your NetID.

      -- Line 3:  The date you edited the file, in YYYY-MM-DD
                  format.  (For example, 1912-06-23)

  6. Change line 11 in the hmwk_01.cs file to be whatever is
     necessary to print "Hello, world!" when this C# program is
     compiled and run.

  7. Change line 8 in the hmwk_01.java file to be whatever is
     necessary to print "Hello, world!" when this Java program is
     compiled and run.

  8. Change line 6 in the hmwk_01.py file to be whatever is
     necessary to print "Hello, world!" when this Python program
     is run.  Ensure that you use Python 3 (THREE!) syntax and not
     Python 2.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission:

Make a zipfile of your 'hmwk_01_abc1234' directory (with your
source files in it) and submit it on Canvas as your results for
this assignment.  REMEMBER: 'abc1234' should be replaced with YOUR
NetID.

You can get dinged points for work not in the proper format so
even if your programs work (and work correctly!), you might not
earn full credit.  Check your work!

There will be a question / answer submission posted separate from
this code submission.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hints:
  1. Ensure your programs compile and run correctly.  Not
     compiling or not generating the correct output
     ("Hello, world!") will cost you points.

     Compare the output of your programs to that in the given
     "output.txt" file.  They should match EXACTLY.  (Use the
     'diff' (UNIX systems) or 'fc' (Windows systems) command to do
     the comparison.)

     'EXACTLY' means absolutely character-by-character the same:
     those thirteen characters then a newline.

  2. Ensure that you update the three header lines in each of the
     source files with YOUR name (family name first, then a comma,
     then your personal name), YOUR NetID, and the date you edit
     the file (in YYYY-MM-DD format).

     Not updating the header lines properly will cost you points.

  3. Ensure that you use Python 3 (THREE!) and not Python 2.
     There are differences between Python 2 and 3 that will affect
     even this simple program.  If your Python program does not
     run properly using Python 3 you will get ZERO points for it.

  4. Ensure your submission is packaged EXACTLY as described above.

      -- Your submission should be a ZIP FILE (not a tar, rar, gz,
         or any other kind of compressed file).

      -- The zip file should be named 'hmwk_01_abc1234.zip' (with
         'abc1234' replaced with YOUR NetID).

      -- This zip file should have ONE item in it, a directory
         named 'hmwk_01_abc1234'  (with 'abc1234' replaced with
         YOUR NetID).

      -- Your source files should be in that directory.  The
         source files should be named hmwk_01.cs / .java / .py.

     Submissions in the wrong format score ZERO points.

  5. After you submit your zip file on Canvas, download it from
     Canvas and check that your submission is in the proper
     format, that the programs run and print the correct string,
     and that you updated the header lines correctly in each of
     the source files.

  6. Are you CERTAIN you complied with all of these nit-picking
     instructions?  Really?  Maybe you ought to check just one
     more time. :)
