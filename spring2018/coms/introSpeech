"In scientific thinking are present elements of poetry. Science and music
requires a thought homogeneous." My name is Chris Jakins, and I am a
Computer Science major.

That was a quote from Albert Einstein, and I like it because it expresses the
kind of thinking that brought me to Computer Science. You see, before this became
my major, I was studying Music and Music Production. Somewhere along the way, I found a 
passion for the technology that creates music, and I decided to switch my 
major to pursue a career of developing software and hardware for musicians. 
Throughout my few years of studying this discipline, I have come to 
understand and appreciate the artistic and creative qualities associated behind it.

Computer Science is more than just programming; in fact, writing code is probably the most
trivial part of a Computer Science degree. What I actually study is how to make machines learn,
how to make innovative designs, and how to make computers do what they haven't done before.
We live in an age where computers can beat people at video games, and where cars can
drive themselves. Automation is playing an increasingly important role in our society, 
and it's Computer Scientists who develop and implement the ideas that lead to a 
more productive future.

My name is Chris Jakins, and I am a Computer Science student. I'll finish of with a
quote from Wynton Marsalis, a world-renowned jazz musician.
"We need more math classes, we need more science. It's the art of math and the art
of science that created all the innovation, and we have a tradition of
great arts, great music."
